\subsection*{Background and Motivation}
Nowadays big server architectures with spreaded servers are very common. To monitor this big architectures, control tools for very distributed systems are needed. Some of these tools are very modular and can be used only for collecting data of the server or for a web representation of this data. On the other hand some systems offer a complete package with consistency in technology.\cite{Heger2017}
This Student Report is to evaluate the different tools on the market and compare them to illustrate there main features and disadvantages.

\subsection*{Goals}
The Student Report lists and discusses the different open source monitoring and alerting tools. The goal is to illustrate the different architectures, features and technologies of the systems to make it easier for the reader, to decide which application is the best for the provided system.
Some of the compared applications are InfluxDB, Prometheus and ELK. As a first step, more tools for comparison will be added to the list.
As a part of the reports, the evaluated systems will be installed on a server to test them in a practicable environment.
